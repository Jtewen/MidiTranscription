# MidiTranscription

A simple python script designed to identify and transcribe input from an external midi controller.


## Current Features

Currently can identify the most common triads and four-note chords (Major Triad, Minor Sixth, Minor-Major Seventh, etc) and output them in console as strings.

## Planned Features

* Up to seven-note chord identification
* Visual Transcription in both symbol as well as sheet music
* Synthesia-styled top-down view
* Audio output
* Recording and playback
* Split into functions into multiple files to ensure scalability

## Dependencies

* Mido
* RTMidi

## Note

This was programmed for use with an Alesis V49 Midi keyboard. Let me know if any issues arise with other midi controllers.
